Linear Classifiers and Logistic Regression:

Motivationg example:
	- restaurant reviews
	- want to capture sentiment as it relates to sushi

Intution about linear classifers:
	- takes an input (X) and outputs a prediction (y)
	- in sentiment classifaction, coefficents are words with numeric values:
		good: 1.0
		great: 1.5
		awsome: 2.7
		bad: -1.0
		terrible: -2.5 
	- A sentence suchs as: "the sushi was great but the service was therribe" 
		score( great 1.5 + -2.5) = -1
	- Need to train the weights of the coefficents from data 
	- After learning the classifier, evaluate for accuracy
	- Decison boundaries: repersent a break along some feature space 
		two features: line
		three features: plane
		four + features: hyperplane
